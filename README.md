# ASLLearningApp
This application leverages Mediapipe gesture recognition and a custom model to teach and evaluate American Sign Language.
Users may learn and practice to sign each character into their webcam, and then be tested and graded on their ability to sign words of varying difficulty.

Produced as a senior capstone project for Spring 2024 at West Virginia University Institute of Technology by Evan Dawson, Seth Lusk, and Everett Krantz.
